/**
 * This script determines the next release version based on the commits made since the last release.
 * It analyzes the commit messages to determine the type of release (major, minor, patch)
 * and increments the version accordingly.
 *
 * For pre-release code (before 1.0.0), it will return 0.1.0 as the first release version and increment
 * from there. This script used to use 1.0.0-alpha.1 type of versioning, but...
 * 1. this script was more complex then it needed to be, especially because the semver library had different
 *    opinions on how to increment pre-release versions.
 * 2. teams I have been on in the past have had opinions or confusion when using the -alpha.1, -beta.1, etc. versions.
 * 3. the semantic versioning spec is loose on how to handle -alpha, -beta, etc. versions and it does suggest
 *    to use 0.1.0 as the first release version and you can make breaking changes until 1.0.0 is released.
