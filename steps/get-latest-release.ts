/**
 * This script retrieves the latest release of the project.
 *
 * This is a very simple script only because of how simple the project's release process is.
 * All release tags are created off of a commit made on the branch 'latest'. Because of this,
 * we just need to ask github for the latest release and that's it.
 *
 * Testing:
 * Assuming that you have `gh` cli installed and authenticated, you can run this script directly.
 * `DATA_FILE_PATH="/tmp/foo.txt" ./steps/get-latest-release.ts && cat /tmp/foo.txt`
